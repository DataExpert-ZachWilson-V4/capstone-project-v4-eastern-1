## Performance Analysis of Drivers and Teams

### Objectives
- To analyze the performance of drivers and teams across different tracks and conditions.
- To study the impact of qualifying performance on race outcomes.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of different pit stop strategies.
- To investigate how different tracks and weather conditions affect race outcomes.

### Metrics Needed
- Lap times
- Sector times
- Speed trap data
- Tire choices and their impact on performance
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rain)
- Pit stop times and strategies
- Qualifying lap times
- Starting grid positions
- Race lap times
- Finishing positions
- Number of overtakes
- Number and timing of pit stops
- Lap times before and after pit stops
- Tire degradation rates
- Track characteristics (length, number of turns, elevation changes)

### Methodology
1. Data Collection: Use FastF1 to collect data on lap times, sector times, speed, tire choices, pit stops, weather conditions, and more.
2. Data Analysis:
Perform statistical analysis to find correlations and trends.
Use visualization tools to create insightful graphs and charts.

### Expected Outcomes
1. Insights into which drivers and teams perform best under various conditions.
2. Understanding of how qualifying performance affects race results.
3. Analysis of optimal pit stop strategies.
4. Identification of the most consistent drivers.
5. Insights into track-specific performance and weather impacts.

### Metrics for Success
- Ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
- Visualization of data that clearly communicates findings.
